## About
D.J.Novack is a 3rd year PhD student in the [Voelz Lab](http://www.voelzlab.org/) at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pa. They use MD simulation to investigate biomolecular phenomena relating to disease. 

### Research
Their research interests include investigating disease related mutations and how they effect the ways that proteins fold and bind their ligands. They are also interested in the timescale problem associated with MD simulation. Being a member of a lab that is part of the [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/) consortium, they have used massively parallel computing to investigate protein folding. To this end, they are also interested in using GPU-accelerated metadynamics simulations to accurately investigate folding and binding to more efficiently rpedict experimental observables.


### Teaching
Work in progress.
