[This article](https://medium.com/@chanda/decolonising-science-reading-list-339fb773d51f) by Chanda Prescod-Weinstein contains an extensive reading relating to decolonial though regarding science and technology. Once I work through some of these pieces I will probably write another blog post, but I want this list to be available to those who are interested. Chanda Prescod-Weinstein is a theoretical physicist and assistant professor at University of New Hampshire, as well as a core faculty member in women's studies. She does a lot of interesting writing regarding science, intersectionality, and decolonization.
