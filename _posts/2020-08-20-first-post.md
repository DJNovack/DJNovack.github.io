This is my first post on this website. This site is meant to aggregate my science into one place and I intend to add resources that will be helpful to my students as well. If you're interested in the work that I'm doing, this will be the place to check it out. I will be adding more to it as things come along. I will also probably post miscellaneous things I find interesting here. Hope it's helpful!
