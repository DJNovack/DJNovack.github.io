[This article](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pkyv4n/guide-to-getting-education-without-college) by Zoé Samudzi has some good tips on self directed learning at home that I think is interesting and valuable in these uncertain times. Although the article is a guide to educating yourself without college, I think that a lot of her points are valid and useful for both college and non-college students learning at home in the time of COVID. Zoé Samudzi is co-author, with William Anderson, of the book *As Black As Resistance* and she is a PhD student at UCSF German colonialism, the Herero and Nama genocide and its afterlife, and science’s role in producing indigenous/Black/African identity. I really like her work and if you're into any of that I suggest checking it out.
