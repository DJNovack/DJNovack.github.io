### Research
Their research interests include investigating disease related mutations and how they effect the ways that proteins fold and bind their ligands. They are also interested in the timescale problem associated with MD simulation. Being a member of a lab that is part of the [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/) consortium, they have used massively parallel computing to investigate protein folding. To this end, they are also interested in using GPU-accelerated metadynamics simulations to accurately investigate folding and binding to more efficiently predict experimental observables. Information about some of their work can be found below.

### [FOX01](images/BPS_2020.pdf)
FOX01 is a human forkhead transcription factor involved in insulin signaling. Mutations in this protein have been found in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) patient’s cell lines, and associated with decreased survival in DLBCL patients. I am using massively parallel molecular dynamics simulations and enhanced sampling techniques, such as metadynamics, in order to investigate wild type folding and activity of this protein, in order to make predictions about how clinical mutations may effect the function of this protein with sights on novel diagnostic tools and therepeutics.

### Cyclic Peptides
Peptides and peptidomimetic molecules have promising potential as therapeutics. Being composed of amino acids, these molecules can mimic protein-protein interactions, typically better than small  molecules can, and have a low potential for toxicity. The structures in this project are mimics of “omega loops”, such as portions of stonin-2, a protein that binds Eps15. Eps-15-stonin-2 PPI is involved in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis process, recruiting adapter complex AP-2 to clathrin-coated pits. Disruption of this interaction has displayed reduced infectivity of Ebola, revealing the potential of modulating this pathway as a means of preventative therapy.

There are two main aims of this project. Firstly, we are aiming to explore how these omega loop peptides configure themselves in solution. Secondly, we aim to tackle questions surrounding the preconfiguration of these molecules and their binding to their target. Exploring these questions will provide great insight into the design of protein mimic therapeutics that will allow for more informed design of PPI pathway modulators. These simulations will also present future opportunities for testing tools related to protein-ligand systems that could streamline the peptide-therapeutic design process.
