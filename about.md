### About
Starting their college education at Brookdale Community College in 2012, D.J. Novack graduated with an A.S in Chemistry in 2014, and transfered to Rutgers University. While at Rutgers, they were selected to be a 2015 Rutgers-Jilin Summer Chemistry Fellow, where they worked in the Yang-Meguellati joint lab at Jilin University in Changchun performing synthesis relating to pillar-[5]-arenes. At Rutgers, they did undergraduate research in Dr. David Case's lab investigating different solvation models and their effects on the quantum calculation of 31P NMR chemical shifts in RNA. In 2016, they graduated from Rutgers with a B.A. in Chemistry, with honors. Following graduation, they spent 2 years in industry, working in pharmaceutical Q.C. and biochemical assay manufaturing. In 2018,  they began a PhD at Temple University, where they are now a 3rd year PhD student in [Dr. Vincent Voelz's Lab](http://www.voelzlab.org/) at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pa. They use MD simulation to investigate biomolecular phenomena relating to disease.
