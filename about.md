### About
I am a 5th year PhD candidate in [Dr. Vincent Voelz's Lab](http://www.voelzlab.org/) at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pa. I'm interested in using molecular simulation to build knowledge of how biochemical systems work on the atomic level. This primarily involves studying protein folding, protein-ligand binding, and protein-protein interactions. I am particularly interested how mutations perturb these reactions.I am also interested in massively parallel simulation ( being a reasearcher with [FOLDING@HOME](https://foldingathome.org)) as well as enhanced sampling techniques.
